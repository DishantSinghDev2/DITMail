; --- Authentication Checks (SPF / DKIM) ---
spf_fail = 20         ; Strong signal: SPF failed validation.
spf_softfail = 5    ; Weak signal: SPF is misconfigured or sending IP is not explicitly listed.
spf_permerror = 5   ; Weak signal: SPF record is broken.
spf_pass = -3         ; Good signal: SPF passed.

dkim_fail = 20        ; Strong signal: DKIM signature is invalid.
dkim_pass = -5        ; Strong signal: DKIM signature is valid.

uribl_positive = 25   ; Strong penalty for having a blacklisted URL in the body.

; --- Content and Header Checks ---
